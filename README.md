# TEST DIFERENTS MODELS - EASY IMPLEMENTATION
Repo with diferents codes, to train different kind of models. **THE MAIN IDEA, IS HAVE ONE UNIQUE REPO WITH SIMPLE IMPLEMENTATIONS OF MODELS**. So, when you want to implement a model in a proyect, you can see this code and in a easy way understant the model/code an implement in a more complex pipeline in a project.


## INCOMPLETE - WORK IN PROGESS

## Content
This repo contains differents codes with techniques to train differents  types of machine learning models

List folders with differents types of models:
- **Regression models** (in progress)

- **Classification models** (in progress)

- **Clustering models** (in progress)

- **Stacking models:** emsembles -> stacking models (for example using sklearn class)

- **Modify classes:** modify class in sklearn to train custom machine learning models
