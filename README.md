# Identify-Data-Drift
 Repo with differents machine learning models

## INCOMPLETE - WORK IN PROGESS

## Content
This repo contains differents codes with techniques to train differents  types of machine learning models

List folders with differents types of models:
- **Regression models** (in progress)

- **Classification models** (in progress)

- **Clustering models** (in progress)

- **Stacking models:** emsembles -> stacking models (for example using sklearn class)

- **Modify classes:** modify class in sklearn to train custom machine learning models
